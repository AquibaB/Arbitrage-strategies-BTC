# Arbitrage Opportunities in BTC (Challenge #3 of FinTech Bootcamp)

In this Challenge, I created several calculations to take advantage of Bitcoin's price inefficiencies in 2018 between two crypto exchanges, Coinbase and Bitstamp.

## Technologies

This project uses Python 3.7 and imports the following packages:

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) - For data structuring and analysis.
[pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) - For path-hadling operations.
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html) - For plotting graphs.

## Lessons Learned

1- Upload CSV file with the price information from the two exchanges.

2- Clean up the data.

3- Analyze information with different timeframes (monthly and specific dates)

4- Get summary statistics and plot the data

5- Calculate arbitrage profits and identify profitable trade opportunities
